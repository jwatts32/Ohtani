# Ohtani
"Shohei Otani is not worth $700 mil because his stats don't translate to wins."

I've heard this statement quite a few times leading up to and after Ohtani's new contract with the Dodgers.  This project looks at Ohtani's performance over the last 3 seasons compared to his teammates to analyze what kind of impact he is having on the team.  Are the Angels' lack of success tied to Ohtani or is there a bigger issue within the organization?
